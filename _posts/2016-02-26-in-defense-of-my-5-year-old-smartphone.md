description: 'As the latest and greatest mobile phone technology is unveiled at MWC in Barcelona, I have to sing the praises of my mobile phone. It appeared on the market in 2011 and is still kicking. It annoys my friends when I pull out a spotless, scratch-free phone, which is commonly in the same pocket with my keys.'
