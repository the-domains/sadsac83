description: 'But Sadik-Khan was labeled a zealot by anti-bike groups, community boards, and institutions reluctant to change. Resentment toward the new lanes built steadily, fueled by media awareness that a "war on bikes" made for good headlines: "Newspapers, radio stations, and blogs delivered damning quotes from shopkeepers, people in cars, schoolteachers, and crossing guards to inflame the debate," Sadik-Khan writes.'
